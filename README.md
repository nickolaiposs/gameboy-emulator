# Game Boy Emulator

A Game Boy emulator made in Rust. This is a WIP project whose goal is to make an emulator that is able to run games intended for the Nintendo Game Boy system, with a web frontend made with WebAssembly and ReactJs. This project is for my own study purposes, as a way to learn more about how CPU's and computer hardware works, and as a way to become more familiar with Rust.

## ROMs

This emulator requires ROM files intended for the Game Boy. Do not distribute or download ROMs from official Nintendo Game Boy titles. You can attain ROMs through ripping from Game Boy cartridges that you personally own, or you can download free fan-made ROMs.
